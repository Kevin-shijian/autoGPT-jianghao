            "\" This paper examines the structure, composition, and properties of hybrid neutron stars, which are composed of both nucleons and exotic baryons (hyperons and ∆-resonances). Using a density dependent quark model and a relativistic model within the mean-field approximation, the authors construct an equation of state and use a Maxwell construction to determine the quark-hadron phase transition in the stellar matter. The macroscopic properties of the star are then determined and compared with observational astrophysical data.\n",

            " The detection of gravitational waves from the merging of two neutron stars (GW170817) and the subsequent kilonova event observation in multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum have ushered in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. This has provided new constraints on the equations of state (EoS) of neutron stars and data from NICER has given a clear window for NS mass and radius. Analysis of the GW170817 merger signals has also led to constraints on the radius of the NS, hinting at a possible phase transition in the core of the NS. This has implications for the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram.\n",

            " There is a line that separates hadronic matter from the quark-gluon plasma phase, which is a smooth crossover at high temperatures and low chemical potentials. As the temperature decreases and the chemical potential increases, a first-order phase transition from the hadronic to the quark phase is expected to occur in the inner core of neutron stars. This is due to the tightly packed baryons that may dissociate into a “soup” of deconfined quarks.\n",

            " The equation of state for neutron stars in beta-equilibrium is known to have different characteristics at two extreme limits. At lower densities, a chiral effective field theory can be used to calculate the equation of state with good precision, while at higher densities, perturbative QCD techniques and high energy particle phenomenology give better results. Observations provide indirect information about the matter content in the core of neutron stars.\n",

Observational data has led to several strong constraints, allowing for model-independent approaches. The hadron matter is assumed to be composed of nucleons, hyperons, and delta isobars, and the field equations are solved using the relativistic mean field (RMF) approximation method known as DDME2.\n",

The Lagrangian density of the model is divided into four parts: LH, L∆, Lmesons and Lleptons. LH is a Dirac-type Lagrangian for the baryon octet, while L∆ is a Rarita-Schwinger-type Lagrangian for the baryon decuplet.\n",

The model parameters of the DDME2 were determined by fitting to experimental bulk nuclear matter data around its saturation density n0= 0.152 fm−3.

            " This article discusses the equation of state (EoS) for hybrid stars built with density dependent models. The EoS shows sharp phase transitions at different energy densities, and at lower densities, the quark matter shows similar behavior as the hadrons. The hadronic EoSs composed of different particle contents show phase transitions at different densities, with the smaller hadronic critical chemical potential being 1364 MeV. Adding hyperons to the nucleon matter increases the critical chemical potential, softening the EoS and delaying the phase transition.\n",

            " The inclusion of Delta-isobars in Nuclear Star (NS) models has become standard in recent years, and is actively being investigated at both zero and finite temperatures. This inclusion softens the equation of state (EoS) at low densities and increases the chemical potential, resulting in a sharp discontinuity in the EoS.\n",

            " In order to reduce the maximum mass of a neutron star, Weissenborn et al. (2012) and Lopes et al. (2023) adjusted the baryon-meson coupling of the non-nucleonic components of the stellar matter within the RMF approximation. However, the hadron-quark phase transition did not resolve the so-called “hyperon puzzle” as seen in Lopes & Menezes (2021). The perturbative and nonperturbative regions of the QCD theory with quark and hadron degrees of freedom exhibit bumps in the curves at the lower densities, representing the appearance of new particles.\n",

            " This article examines the differences between quark matter and hadron matter, which can be observed by determining the values of physical quantities such as the speed of sound and polytropic index. The speed of sound is constant in the conformal matter and approaches this value from below at high-density quark matter. The speed of sound can inform us about the star's internal dynamics and composition. The appearance of new degrees of freedom leads to different behaviors of the speed of sound in stellar matter.\n",
            "\n",
            " Chiral effective field theory calculations show that the speed of sound in hadronic matter increases monotonically with density until the onset of new degrees of freedom, such as hyperons and ∆-isobars, which leads to a sudden break in the monotonic behavior. This behavior is in agreement with the results presented in Figs. 3 and 4, which show the appearance of strange quarks and ∆- and Λ0-isobars at high densities. It has been argued that the characteristics of the speed of sound are associated with the size of the quark core in the hybrid star.\n",

            " This study investigated the mass and radii of a hybrid star, and found that if c2s is less than 1/3, a massive neutron star is expected to have a massive quark core. The most massive neutron star is composed of only nucleons at low densities.\n",

            " Issifu et al. studied the polytropic index as a function of baryon density, and found that the hadron-quark phase transition takes place in a gray region. The black, red, and blue vertical lines indicate where the N-quark, NH-quark, and NH∆-quark phase transitions start, respectively. The quark core is responsible for 11% of the mass of the star, and the polytropic index attains a value of γ= 1 in the conformal matter region.\n",

            " This figure shows the particle composition of a star before, during, and after a hadron-quark phase transition. The value of γ rises from 2 to 3.5 in the hadronic matter region, then drops sharply due to the transition, until it reaches 1 in the quark matter region. The maximum value obtained in the hadronic matter region is slightly higher than the chiral effective field theory prediction.\n",

The hadron-quark phase transition is delayed by adding new degrees of freedom to the stellar matter. At densities of 5n0, the core of the star is mainly composed of quark matter, with d-quark being the most dominant. The study also uses the EoSs generated to calculate the mass and radii of the star using TOV equations.\n",

They constructed their equations of state (EoSs) for the study using the Maxwell method with a sharp hadron-quark phase transition and determined the properties of the hybrid star, such as the EoS, cs,γ,Mmax,RmaxandYi.

            " This study determined a hybrid neutron star with a maximum mass below the 2 M⊙ threshold, composed of baryon octet, ∆-isobars, and a quark core. It was observed that hybrid neutron stars are more likely to be composed of non-strange baryons at low baryon densities, while baryons with strangeness are found towards the center of the star. A relationship was established between the µc, hadron-quark phase transition, softening of the EoS, and the composition of particles in the star. Higher values of µc imply softer EoS, delay in the phase transition, and higher particle degrees of freedom in the star. The value of Pc also informs us about the phase transition, structure, and composition of the star.\n",
